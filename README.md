# DNA Analysis Tool

This is a simple tool to introduce students to the fundamentals of DNA analysis, based on some of the things I learned during my internship in the summer of 2024

## A comprehensive toolkit for DNA sequence analysis and manipulation.

This module provides a collection of tools for:
- DNA sequence validation and manipulation
- Sequence property analysis (GC content, melting temperature)
- Pattern searching and alignment
- Random sequence generation
- Thermodynamic calculations
